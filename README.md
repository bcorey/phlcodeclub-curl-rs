## Simple Curl Impl in Rust
This is the project that will be used to teach the upcoming PHL Code Club Rust workshop.
Participants will learn Rust fundamentals while building a simple version of `curl`.

## Install your rust binary
Just run `cargo install --path .`

You can now invoke your app by typing the package name in `cargo.toml`!

To uninstall your app, just run `cargo uninstall my-app`.
